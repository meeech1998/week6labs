    "Hi ChatGPT, I‚Äôm working on my Week 6 Instructor-led Lab for my graduate Python course (BGEN 632 - UM MSBA). The assignment is to create a Magic Crystal Ball program using arrays/lists, loops, and menu logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not looking for final answers. I want help understanding how to approach the assignment step-by-step, especially using Boolean values to switch menu prompts, storing questions/responses in lists, and generating random responses from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you walk me through how I should structure the logic using pseudo-code or examples‚Äîwithout giving me the full solution? I‚Äôll write my own code based on what I learn. Assignment: # Instructor-led Lab\n",

    "In this assignment you will practice utilizing arrays and/or lists in a program. \n",

    "## Magic Crystal Ball\n",
    "\n",
    "You have decided your future does not lie in data science. Instead, you would like to ply your trade in fortune telling. As someone who has a solid understanding of technology, you decide to eschew a physical store and practice solely online. As such, you are keen on developing a program that will behave like a magic crystal ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your vast research into \"magic crystal ball\" fortune telling, you decide on the following responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is certain\n",
    "* It is decidedly so\n",
    "* That question requires greater monetary compensation\n",
    "* Reply is hazy; try again, with more money\n",
    "* Concentrate and ask again\n",
    "* My reply is no\n",
    "* Outlook is not so good\n",
    "* Very doubtful\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these 8 responses, *you will also provide 3 more of your own*. Make sure your personality shows through *by not making them generic*. Save all of these responses in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompt the user to \"Ask a question,\" \"Review questions and responses,\" and \"Complete services and pay.\"\n",
    "   * If they already asked their first question, change the menu from \"Ask *a* question\" to \"Ask *another* question.\" Keep track of this with a boolean.\n",
    "2. Always provide the menu until the user decides to complete their use of the magic crystal ball.\n",
    "3. Store the user's questions and received responses in an array/list. When the user selects the option \"Review questions and responses\" display all the questions asked and their respective answers to the screen.\n",
    "4. **Randomly** select a response from your catalog of responses as a reply to the user's question (see below for guidance).\n",
    "5. Keep track of how much the user owes for services. You charge $30.00 per question asked. Thus, when the user completes their use of your services, you will display the total owed and the count of the questions asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run your program, please input **at least 4 questions**. Save your notebook with the output of your program showing that: \n",
    "* You have run the program and inputted at least 4 questions.\n",
    "* Selected the other menu options to display questions/responses and complete services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of program output with 2 questions:\n",

    "### Randomness in Programming \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will need to use a random number generator. Specifically, you will need to generate a random number within the range of your list's elements. A range is used in order to constrain the generated number to fit within the bounds of the number of elements within your list. To do so, you can rely on the library `random`. Here is an example with a list containing cities in Montana.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "some_list[rand_a]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative, you can generate a random selection from a list using the function `choice()`. This is the preferred method for lists, arrays, and dictionaries.\n",
